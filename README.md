| `replacement` | `string` \| `object` |  `{}`   | Sets the characters replaced in the mask, where "key" is the replaced character, "value" is the regular expression to which the input character must match (see «[Replacement](https://github.com/GoncharukBro/react-input/tree/main/packages/mask#replacement)»). It is possible to pass the replacement character as a string, then `replacement="_"` will default to `replacement={{ _: /./ }}`. Keys are ignored as you type. |
| `showMask`    |      `boolean`       | `false` | Controls the display of the mask, for example, `+7 (912) ___-__-__` instead of `+7 (912`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `separate`    |      `boolean`       | `false` | Stores the position of the entered characters. By default, input characters are non-breaking, which means that if you remove characters in the middle of the value, the characters are shifted to the left, forming a non-breaking value, which is the behavior of `input`. For example, with `true`, the possible value is `+7 (912) ___-67-__`, with `false` - `+7 (912) 67_-__-__`.                                            |

> You can also pass other properties available element `input` default or your own components, when integrated across the property `component`.

## Usage

The `@react-input/mask` package provides two options for using a mask. The first is the `InputMask` component, which is a standard input element with additional logic to handle the input. The second is using the `useMask` hook, which needs to be linked to the `input` element through the `ref` property.

One of the key features of the `@react-input/mask` package is that it only relies on user-supplied characters, so you can safely include any character in the mask without fear of the «unexpected behavior».

Let's see how you can easily implement a mask for entering a phone number using the `InputMask` component:

```jsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  return <InputMask mask="+7 (___) ___-__-__" replacement={{ _: /\d/ }} />;
}
```

You can work with the `InputMask` component in the same way as with the `input` element, with the difference that the `InputMask` component uses additional logic to process the value.

Now the same thing, but using the `useMask` hook:

```jsx
import { useMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  const inputRef = useMask({ mask: '+7 (___) ___-__-__', replacement: { _: /\d/ } });

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

The `useMask` hook takes the same properties as the `InputMask` component, except for the `component` properties. Both approaches are equivalent, but the use of the `InputMask` component provides additional capabilities, which will be discussed in the section «[Integration with custom components](https://github.com/GoncharukBro/react-input/tree/main/packages/mask#integration-with-custom-components)».

> The `InputMask` component does not change the value passed in the `value` or `defaultValue` property of the `input` element, so specify as the initialized value one that can match the masked value at any stage of input. If you make a mistake, you will see a warning about it in the console.

## Replacement

The `replacement` property sets the characters to be replaced in the mask, where "key" is the replaced character, "value" is the regular expression to which the input character must match. You can set one or more replaceable characters with different regexps,

like this:

```jsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  return <InputMask mask="dd.mm.yyyy" replacement={{ d: /\d/, m: /\d/, y: /\d/ }} showMask separate />;
}
```

It is possible to pass the replacement character as a string, then any characters will be allowed. For example, `replacement="_"` is the same as `replacement={{ _: /./ }}`.

> Do not use entered characters as `replacement` keys. For example, if you only allow numbers to be entered, given that the user can enter "9", then you should not set `replacement` to `{ 9: /\d/ }`, because keys are ignored when typing. Thus, the input of any numbers except "9" will be allowed.

## Modify

The `modify` function is triggered before masking and allows you conditionally change the properties of the component that affect the masking.

The `modify` function expects to return an object containing the data to modify, optionally including `mask`, `replacement`, `showMask` and `separate`, or to return `undefined`. Changes will be only applied to those properties that were returned, so you can change any property as you like, or not change any property by passing `undefined`.

The `modify` function takes a value without mask characters that is valid at the time of input. For example, if the `mask` property has the value `+7 (___) ___-__-__` and the previous value is `+7 (123) ___-__-__` and the user entered the character "4" at the ninth index of the value, then `modify` will take the value "1234". Note that there are no mask characters including "7" as well. Using this value you can modify the properties with the expected result.

Let's consider a possible situation when we need to change the mask depending on the phone city code:

```jsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  const modify = (input) => {
    return { mask: input[0] === '7' ? '+_ (___) ___-__-__' : undefined };
  };

  return <InputMask mask="+_ __________" replacement={{ _: /\d/ }} modify={modify} />;
}
```

The advantage of this approach is that you do not need to store the state of the component to change its properties, the modification happens in the already running masking process.

## Mask event

It can be useful to have additional data about the value at hand, for this you can use the `input-mask` event.

The `input-mask` event is fired asynchronously after the `change` event, in addition, the `input-mask` event object has a `detail` property that contains additional useful information about the value:

| Name      |    Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`   |  `string`  | Masked value (same as `event.target.value`).                                                                                                                                                |
| `input`   |  `string`  | Value without mask characters.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `parts`   | `object[]` | Parts of the masked value, where each object contains the character type: `replacement` - the replacement character; `mask` - mask character; `input` is the character entered by the user. |
| `pattern` |  `string`  | A regular expression of type `string` that the masked value must match.                                                                                                                     |
| `isValid` | `boolean`  | `true` if the mask is full and matches the pattern value.                                                                                                                                   |

By itself, the `input-mask` event can completely replace the `change` event, but you should not use it if it is not necessary, since the `input-mask` event is called asynchronously after the `change` event has completed, which may lead to additional rendering of the component. Consider the `input-mask` event as an optional feature, not a required feature.

> You can use both the `input-mask` event and the `change` event to save the state, however, if you don't need additional parameters in the `detail` property, prefer the `change` event.

An example of using the `input-mask` event:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  const [detail, setDetail] = useState(null);

  return (
    <>
      <InputMask
        mask="1yyy"
        replacement={{ _: /\d/ }}
        value={detail?.value ?? ''}
        onMask={(event) => setDetail(event.detail)}
      />
      {detail.input && !detail.isValid && <span>The field is not filled.</span>}
    </>
  );
}
```

> Note that in the example above we are checking for `detail.input`, this is because we only want to display the error text if the user entered numbers. Thus, if you only want the numbers from the masked value, the `event.detail.input` property will not contain the numbers from the mask, since they are mask characters. So, in the example above (`mask="1yyy"`), if you enter the value "991", the value in the property `event.detail.input` will match the entered value "991", but not "1991".

## Integration with custom components

The `InputMask` component makes it easy to integrate with custom components allowing you to use your own styled components. To do this, you need to pass the custom component to the `forwardRef` method provided by React. `forwardRef` allows you automatically pass a `ref` value to a child element ([more on `forwardRef`](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)).

Then place your own component in the `component` property. The value for the `component` property can be either function components or class components.

With this approach, the `InputMask` component acts as a HOC, adding additional logic to the `input` element.

Here's how to do it:

```jsx
import { forwardRef } from 'react';

import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

// Custom input component
const CustomInput = forwardRef(({ label }, forwardedRef) => {
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor="custom-input">{label}</label>
      <input ref={forwardedRef} id="custom-input" />
    </>
  );
});

// Component with InputMask
export default function App() {
  return <InputMask component={CustomInput} mask="___-___" replacement="_" label="Label for custom component" />;
}
```

> The `InputMask` component will not forward properties available only to the `InputMask`, so as not to break the logic of your own component.

## Integration with Material UI

If you are using [Material UI](https://mui.com/), you need to create a component that returns a `InputMask` and pass it as a value to the `inputComponent` property of the Material UI component.

In this case, the Material UI component will pass an additional `inputRef` property to your component, which you will need to pass as the value for the `ref` property of the element of the `InputMask` component.

Here's how to do it:

```jsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

import { TextField } from '@material-ui/core';

// Component with InputMask
function InputMaskComponent({ inputRef, ...props }) {
  return <InputMask ref={inputRef} mask="___-___" replacement="_" {...props} />;
}

// Component with Material UI
export default function App() {
  return (
    <TextField
      InputProps={{
        inputComponent: CustomInputMaskComponent,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Usage with TypeScript

The `@react-input/mask` package is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), so you have full type support out of the box. In addition, you can import the types you need for your use:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';
import type { MaskEventDetail, MaskEventHandler, Modify } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  const [detail, setDetail] = useState<MaskEventDetail, null>(null);

  // Or `event: MaskEvent`
  const handleMask: MaskEventHandler = (event) => {
    setDetail(event.detail);
  };

  const modify: Modify = (input) => {
    return undefined;
  };

  return <InputMask mask="___-___" replacement="_" modify={modify} onMask={handleMask} />;
}
```

### Property type support

Since the `InputMask` component supports two use cases (as an `input` element and as an HOC for your own component), `InputMask` takes both use cases into account to support property types.

By default, the `InputMask` component is an `input` element and supports all the attributes supported by the `input` element. But if the `component` property was passed, the `InputMask` will additionally support the properties available to the integrated component. This approach allows you to integrate your own component as conveniently as possible, not forcing you to rewrite its logic, but using a mask where necessary.

```tsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

export default function App() {
  // Here, since no `component` property was passed,
  // `InputMask` returns an `input` element and takes the type:
  // `InputMaskProps & React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>`
  return <InputMask mask="___-___" replacement="_" />;
}
```

```tsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

import { CustomInput, type CustomInputProps } from './CustomInput';

export default function App() {
  // Here, since the `component` property was passed,
  // `InputMask` returns the integrated component and takes the type:
  // `InputMaskProps & CustomInputProps` (the same as `InputMaskProps<CustomInputProps>`)
  return <InputMask component={CustomInput} mask="___-___" replacement="_" />;
}
```

You may run into a situation where you need to pass rest parameters (`...rest`) to the `InputMask` component. If the rest parameters is of type `any`, the `component` property will not be typed correctly, as well as the properties of the component being integrated. this is typical TypeScript behavior for dynamic type inference.

To remedy this situation and help the `InputMask` type correctly the properties of your component, you can pass the property type of your component directly to the `InputMask` component.

```tsx
import { InputMask } from '@react-input/mask';

import { CustomInput, type CustomInputProps } from './CustomInput';

export default function Component(props: any) {
  return <InputMask<CustomInputProps> component={CustomInput} mask="___-___" replacement="_" {...props} />;
}
```

## Testing

Because each input performs the necessary calculations to set the formatting of the value, you need to set a delay between character inputs when testing the input in your application, otherwise the test may not succeed due to the necessary changes between inputs not taking effect.

The recommended delay time is 15 milliseconds, however, you may need to set a different time, which can be found experimentally.

## Other packages from `@react-input`

- [`@react-input/number-format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-input/number-format) - apply locale-specific number, currency, and percentage formatting to input using a provided component or hook bound to the input element.
